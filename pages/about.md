*Early Chinese in Montreal* is an exhibit that has both a physical and digital component. Both are inspired by original research conducted by graduate students in one of Dr. Mary Chapman's UBC English graduate seminars. The digital exhibit attempts to provide more longevity, interaction, and access to this original research.

From September 28-30, 2023, *Early Chinese in Montreal* was exhibited as a pop-up of nine retractable banners as part of the JIA Foundation's [Chinatown Reimagined Forum II](https://jiafoundationmtl.org/chinatownreimagined/) in Montreal, QC. Each banner features images and a tri-lingual blurb with QR codes that correspond to historical biographies and relevant exhibit pages.

Exhibit items are a combination of primary archival sources like government documents, newspaper articles, photographs, illustrations, and creative works produced by and about some of the historic figures featured in the exhibit. Each historical figure also has a biographical essay that helps contextualize the exhibit objects and shed new light on the people who helped make Montreal's early Chinese community.

Where possible, we have provided tri-lingual translations in English, Traditional Chinese, and French so as to make this research more publicly accessible to wider publics. We regret that this is not fully implemented throughout the digital exhibit. While digital tools can open up access, they also have their limitations. At the moment, all the object metadata is only in English. As a result, the pages that pull from the metadata are also only in English/Western syntax (e.g. the timeline, map, and data). The ArcGIS StoryMaps are also in English. However, the historical biographies and exhibit page texts are all tri-lingual.
